### Welcome.
Presenting digital history often means blending traditional historical research with digital modes of public and material culture history. This 3D material-culture approach to digital history explores the use of simple digital tools to create digital models and exhibitions using basic cameras and software anyone can get their hands on. Weâ€™ll also talk about how to use 3D imaging as a pedagogical tool in history classrooms. 

### Tentative Schedule

### Preparation
Please bring a laptop if possible. Given our limited time, please pre-install the following free software and sign up for accounts **before our first session at 9am on Thursday**:

- [PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/) The leading photogrammetry software.

 A demo mode is available for free that will let you try everything except exporting and saving your model. If you want to explore more, they offer a [30-day free trial](http://www.agisoft.com/downloads/request-trial/) of the full Standard or full Professional editions. 
    
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) the leading location for sharing and displaying 3D models

 Register for a free account, since we'll be uploading our models and exploring the viewer options.

- [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/) an open source set of tools for creating, processing and cleaning 3D models 

OPTIONAL:
- [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/get-unity) a game engine that can be used to create interactive experiences with your models. 

 We will demo a [Virtual Museum example project](www.medhieval.com/museum_demo), which you'll be able to download and follow along with, if desired.

Please let me know if you run into trouble.
