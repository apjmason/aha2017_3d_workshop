### Welcome.
3D modeling and Virtual Reality (VR) are exciting fields that have seen dramatic growth recently due to the availability of low cost hardware. These technologies allow users to immerse themselves in virtual worlds and experience a simulation of reality.  The benefits of these digital approaches to the liberal arts are many: they range from increasing historical empathy, to changing attitudes and behaviors, to developing more effective strategies for therapy and pain management. In this track we will present examples from current scholarship showing cutting edge use cases and introduce free and readily available software for getting started creating virtual environments.
