<a id="session-1" class="anchor" href="#session-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Session 1</h3>

<p>The first session will provide an introduction to 3D modeling and Virtual Reality, and an overview of key terminology and basic concepts.</p>
  
<p>Our demo project for the course will be a virtual museum.  We chose this project since it includes many elements common to any 3D or virtual reality project, but in a cultural heritage application that should be of interest to humanists.</p>

<p>Once you have installed Unity, <strong>download the project files by clicking on the zipped folders at the top of the page</strong>.  Extract the files into the Unity directory and double-click on the demo-scene to launch.</p>

<p>In this session we will highlight some resources for finding downloadable 3D models, and introduce the basics of 3D modeling with SketchUp.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://sketchfab.com">Sketchfab.com</a> is one of the best communities for uploading and sharing 3D models.  Some are for game design and animation, but many are accurate scans of artifacts made using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry">photogrammetry</a> from cultural heritage institutions like the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum">British Museum</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://3d.si.edu/browser" title="Browser | Smithsonian X 3D">The Smithosonian X3D</a> project contains a fantastic viewer for high quality scans, some of which are downloadable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://hampson.cast.uark.edu/" title="The Virtual Hampson Museum">The Virtual Hampson Museum</a> was an early and exemplary model for a digitized public, downloadable museum collection.</li>
  <li>3D Warehouses contain models others have created, some available to download for free, many paid</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com">SketchUp 3D Warehouse</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/">The Unity Asset Store</a></li>

</ul>

<h5>SketchUp Resources</h5>
<p>There are millions of SketchUp tutorials available online (just google SketchUp + what-you-want-to-do and you will be overwhelmed with options), but here is a targeted list of resources to get you started.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you haven&#8217;t already, download and print out a <a title="SketchUp Quick Reference Cards" href="http://help.sketchup.com/en/article/3000081#qrc" target="_blank">Quick Reference Card</a>, so that you can learn the keyboard shortcuts to switch between tools and get good fast.</li>
  <li>Watch the <a title="Getting Started with SketchUp" href="http://www.sketchup.com/learn/videos/58?playlist=58" target="_blank">Getting Started with SketchUp tutorial videos</a>.  The first two are particularly useful for basic drawing, but the third and fourth will give you more advanced techniques and tool tips, if you&#8217;d like to explore further.</li>
  <li>SketchUp has also put out a couple series of videos that let you watch pros at work and give you great advice.
    <ul>
      <li>A good quick start guide is <a title="SketchUp Basics for K-12 Education" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A29A6B9E312A112" target="_blank">SketchUp Basics for K-12 Education</a>, which offers a nice introduction to modeling buildings.</li>
      <li>If you have a question about a particular tool or technique, the <a title="SketchUp Training Series" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fbvtc2eLzU&amp;list=PL190C90DCE62242C9" target="_blank">SketchUp Training Series</a> is the place to go.</li>
